            <p>Hello, I'm Saurav Kumar ,currently pursing my B.Tech(CSE) from Amity University Patna with a passion for
               using
               technology to solve complex problems. As a lifelong learner, I'm constantly seeking out new challenges
               and
               opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.
               My goal is to apply my technical skills to make a positive impact on the world. I believe that technology
               can be a
               powerful force for good, and I'm excited to explore new ways to leverage it for the greater good. I'm
               always
               looking for new opportunities to connect with other like-minded professionals and explore new
               possibilities.

               Thank you for taking the time to read my profile. I look forward to connecting with you and discussing
               how we can
               work together to make a difference through technology</p>
